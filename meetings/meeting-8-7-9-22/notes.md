### Agenda

- Using ? as unwrap method
- Structs
- Impl

#### Using ? as unwrap method

The question mark (?) operator in Rust is used as an error propagation alternative to functions that return Result or Option types. The ? operator is a shortcut as it reduces the amount of code needed to immediately return Err or None from the types Result<T, Err> or Option in a function.

### Other Items Covered


    
### This Weeks Task
> Same as last week
- Find files within the `/ol` folder that have `.unwrap()` and add a match. Make sure these exit gracfully.
> For the adventurous look in `/cli/src/node` folder
- Find uses of `.clone()` and remove them. This may require refactoring of related files
