## Agenda

### Follow Up - Last Lesson

- Round the room about progress and any issues.
    - Everyone had gone through and set up environments. Most reported that using rustfmt just made some minor syntax changes and prettified the code.
    - Kalvinen mentioned that some errors occured while building the source after the changes.

### Resources
- [Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMJlQ5B-M0&list=PLVvjrrRCBy2JSHf9tGxGKJ-bYAN_uDCUL) - OD mentioned this is simple but very helpful

-  [Borrow Checker Article](https://blog.logrocket.com/introducing-the-rust-borrow-checker/)

### Agenda

- Borrow Checker
- ~~Test Given Approach~~

### Other Items Covered

- Option Type - Utilized to prevent null values/ handle them. Has the following attributes
    - can expect two values
    - Some = has a value
    - None = null
    - load of functions built in eg `.is_some()` =  checks we have some value.
- Result Type - Utilized more than Option with extra functionality
- Advanced pattern used in Rust that allows handling only when we have a value
` if let Some() {insert code here}` 


### This Weeks Task
- Go over the tutorials given in the resources section
- Provide an example with the borrow checker


### Outreach
- Added a post on FreeCodeCamp but it is currently waiting for moderators to accept
